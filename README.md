### Hi there 👋

I'm a recovering copy-paster. Got traumatized by Java while studying Cognitive Science, went out into the world and… moved to [Jawa Timur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Java) for a while. I had all sorts of life adventures in teaching, communication, and peopling - among others. After spending some time doing sales I decided to try building things instead. I did a full stack development bootcamp, was shown cURL and got hooked.

These days I enjoy anything that comes with a CLI and eradicates the need for pressing ctrl+c. I work in [Site Reliability Engineering](https://linkedin.com/in/dariagru) and I'm building [CyberMagnolia](http://cybermagnolia.com/) - Women's Tech Collective.

I run on coffee and pancakes.
